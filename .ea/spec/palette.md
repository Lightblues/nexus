# Command Palette

Raycast-style global launcher for triggering Nexus actions — both from a hotkey
UI and from external URL-scheme calls.

## Dual invocation surfaces, one source of truth

```
         ┌────────────────────────┐
Hotkey → │  PaletteWindow (UI)    │ ─┐
         └────────────────────────┘  │
                                     ├──→  CommandRegistry  ──→  Service calls
  nexus://command/… ──────────────────┘     (single table)       (PomodoroService, …)
```

Each feature registers commands in `CommandRegistry` on startup. Palette UI and
URL-scheme handler are **read-only consumers** — adding a command requires no
changes in either input layer.

## Global Hotkey

- Default: `CommandOrControl+Shift+Space` (configurable via `config.yaml`)
- Rejected alternatives:
  - `Cmd+Space` — Spotlight
  - `Option+Space` — reserved for Raycast
  - `Ctrl+Space` — conflicts with macOS "Select previous input source"
- Registered via Electron `globalShortcut`; hot-reloaded when
  `hotkey.palette` changes in config.
- Toggle behavior: if palette is visible, hide it; otherwise show it. Opening
  the palette always hides the tray popover to avoid two overlapping surfaces.

## PaletteWindow

Frameless, transparent, always-on-top (`screen-saver` level so it floats above
full-screen apps), 640×420, centered horizontally and at ~22% from the top of
the active display's work area (matches Raycast's visual position).

On macOS the window is created with `type: 'panel'` so showing/focusing it
does **not** call `[NSApp activate]` and therefore does not yank other Nexus
windows (notably MainWindow) to the global foreground. The hotkey and the
main window stay visually independent — same model as Spotlight / Raycast
preferences. (See ADR-013.)

Loaded via URL hash `#/palette` — the existing renderer handles it alongside
`#/stats`, `#/settings`, `#/tracker` (ADR-006 routing rule preserved).

## PaletteView (renderer)

| Area | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| Search input | Autofocused on show; text is selected so the next keystroke replaces the previous query |
| Results | Substring-first scoring, subsequence fallback; fields ranked: title > group > keywords > subtitle |
| Keyboard | ↑/↓ navigate, `Enter` run, `Esc` close; hover selects |
| Footer | Home icon (→ `window.openMain`) · toast messages (success/failure) · result count · key hints |
| Discoverability | Empty query → all currently-applicable commands (VSCode command-palette style) |

## URL Scheme

Shape: `nexus://command/<id>?<args>`

Examples:
- `nexus://command/pomodoro.toggle`
- `nexus://command/pomodoro.start?project=work`

Registration:
- `app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('nexus')` at startup
- `Info.plist` declared via `electron-builder.yml` → `protocols`
- Handled on `open-url` (macOS) and `second-instance` (cold start / other platforms)
- Single-instance lock required so repeat invocations reuse the running app

Security note: commands flagged `dangerous: true` should require a UI
confirmation when triggered from `url-scheme` (not yet implemented; future
work).

## Registered commands (initial)

| ID | When | Action |
|----|------|--------|
| `pomodoro.toggle` | always | Smart: idle→start, running→pause, paused→resume |
| `pomodoro.start` | idle / finished | Start a focus session |
| `pomodoro.pause` | running | Pause current session |
| `pomodoro.resume` | paused | Resume paused session |
| `pomodoro.finishEarly` | running/paused (work) | Record session and move to finished |
| `pomodoro.exit` | running / paused | Discard current session (dangerous) |
| `window.openMain` | always | Open main window (default route = stats) |
| `window.openStats` | always | Open main window at `/stats` |
| `window.openTracker` | always | Open main window at `/tracker` |
| `window.openSettings` | always | Open main window at `/settings` |
| `app.quit` | always | Quit Nexus (dangerous) |

Subtitles are dynamic — e.g. `pomodoro.toggle` shows `running · 12:34 · click to pause`.

## Focus restoration on dismiss

Because the palette is an `NSPanel`-style window, opening it never activates
the Nexus app — the previously active app keeps its activation throughout.
On dismiss we simply `hide()` the window; we deliberately do **not** call
`app.hide()` (which would also hide MainWindow if the user had it open).

PaletteView **must** use `height: 100%`, not `height: 100vh`. The global
`#root` selector applies `padding: 16px` (shared across all renderer views).
`100vh` fills the entire BrowserWindow viewport *including* the padding area,
so the bottom ~16 px of the component overflows and is clipped by the
container's `overflow: hidden` + `borderRadius: 12px`. Using `100%` respects
the parent's content box and keeps the footer fully visible regardless of how
many commands are listed.

## Extending

1. Create `features/<feature>/commands.ts`
2. Export `register<Feature>Commands()` that calls `commandRegistry.registerMany([...])`
3. Call it from `main/index.ts` before `registerPaletteIPC()`

Commands inherit existing service state — they are not a new abstraction, just
a second entry point.
